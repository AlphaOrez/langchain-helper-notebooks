Any more questions? Okay.  \\nSo this endows linear regression with a proba bilistic interpretati on. I’m actually going to \\nuse this probabil – use this, sort of, probabilist ic interpretation in order to derive our next \\nlearning algorithm, which will be our first classification algorithm. Okay? So you’ll recall \\nthat I said that regression problems are where the variable Y that you’re trying to predict \\nis continuous values. Now I’m actually gonna ta lk about our first cl assification problem, \\nwhere the value Y you’re trying to predict will be discreet value. You can take on only a \\nsmall number of discrete values and in th is case I’ll talk about binding classification \\nwhere Y takes on only two values, right? So you  come up with classi fication problems if \\nyou’re trying to do, say, a medical diagnosis and try to decide based on some features that \\nthe patient has a disease or does not have a di sease.
